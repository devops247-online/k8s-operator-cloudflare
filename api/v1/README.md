# API v1 Package

This package contains the Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) for the Cloudflare DNS Operator.

## Structure

- `cloudflarerecord_types.go` - Main API types and structures
- `groupversion_info.go` - API group and version definitions
- `zz_generated.deepcopy.go` - Auto-generated DeepCopy methods

## Test Coverage

The API package shows low test coverage (1.1%) which is expected and acceptable because:

1. **Auto-generated code**: The majority of code in this package is auto-generated DeepCopy methods
2. **Generated by controller-gen**: These methods are created by `make generate` command
3. **Tested implicitly**: DeepCopy methods are tested through controller and integration tests
4. **Industry standard**: It's common practice to exclude generated code from coverage metrics

### What is actually tested:

- ✅ All custom validation logic
- ✅ Type creation and initialization
- ✅ Constants and enums
- ✅ Edge cases for all fields

### What is not directly tested:

- ❌ `zz_generated.deepcopy.go` - Auto-generated methods

## Regenerating Code

To regenerate the DeepCopy methods:

```bash
make generate
```

This will update `zz_generated.deepcopy.go` based on the types defined in `cloudflarerecord_types.go`.
