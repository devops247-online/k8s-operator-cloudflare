# Cloudflare DNS Operator

A Kubernetes operator for managing DNS records in Cloudflare using the official Cloudflare Go SDK.

## Description

This operator allows you to manage DNS records in Cloudflare directly from Kubernetes using Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs). It provides a declarative way to create, update, and delete DNS records while following Kubernetes best practices for operator development.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- go version v1.24.0+
- docker version 17.03+.
- kubectl version v1.11.3+.
- Access to a Kubernetes v1.11.3+ cluster.

### To Deploy on the cluster
**Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/k8s-operator-cloudflare:tag
```

**NOTE:** This image ought to be published in the personal registry you specified.
And it is required to have access to pull the image from the working environment.
Make sure you have the proper permission to the registry if the above commands donâ€™t work.

**Install the CRDs into the cluster:**

```sh
make install
```

**Deploy the Manager to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/k8s-operator-cloudflare:tag
```

> **NOTE**: If you encounter RBAC errors, you may need to grant yourself cluster-admin
privileges or be logged in as admin.

**Create instances of your solution**
You can apply the samples (examples) from the config/sample:

```sh
kubectl apply -k config/samples/
```

>**NOTE**: Ensure that the samples has default values to test it out.

### To Uninstall
**Delete the instances (CRs) from the cluster:**

```sh
kubectl delete -k config/samples/
```

**Delete the APIs(CRDs) from the cluster:**

```sh
make uninstall
```

**UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:**

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Project Distribution

Following the options to release and provide this solution to the users.

### By providing a bundle with all YAML files

1. Build the installer for the image built and published in the registry:

```sh
make build-installer IMG=<some-registry>/k8s-operator-cloudflare:tag
```

**NOTE:** The makefile target mentioned above generates an 'install.yaml'
file in the dist directory. This file contains all the resources built
with Kustomize, which are necessary to install this project without its
dependencies.

2. Using the installer

Users can just run 'kubectl apply -f <URL for YAML BUNDLE>' to install
the project, i.e.:

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<org>/k8s-operator-cloudflare/<tag or branch>/dist/install.yaml
```

### By providing a Helm Chart

1. Build the chart using the optional helm plugin

```sh
kubebuilder edit --plugins=helm/v1-alpha
```

2. See that a chart was generated under 'dist/chart', and users
can obtain this solution from there.

**NOTE:** If you change the project, you need to update the Helm Chart
using the same command above to sync the latest changes. Furthermore,
if you create webhooks, you need to use the above command with
the '--force' flag and manually ensure that any custom configuration
previously added to 'dist/chart/values.yaml' or 'dist/chart/manager/manager.yaml'
is manually re-applied afterwards.

## Development

### Prerequisites for Development
- Go 1.24.0+
- Docker 17.03+
- kubectl v1.11.3+
- Access to a Kubernetes cluster (local or remote)
- golangci-lint (automatically installed via Makefile)

### Local Development Workflow

#### 1. Clone and Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/devops247-online/k8s-operator-cloudflare.git
cd k8s-operator-cloudflare

# Quick setup with provided script
./scripts/setup-dev.sh

# Or manually install development dependencies
make setup-envtest
make controller-gen
make kustomize
```

#### 2. Code Quality and Testing

**Run all tests:**
```bash
make test                    # Run unit tests with coverage
make test-e2e               # Run end-to-end tests (requires Kind cluster)
```

**Linting and code quality:**
```bash
make lint                   # Run golangci-lint
make lint-fix               # Run golangci-lint and auto-fix issues
make lint-config            # Verify linter configuration
make fmt                    # Format Go code
make vet                    # Run go vet
```

**Code generation:**
```bash
make generate               # Generate DeepCopy methods
make manifests              # Generate CRDs and RBAC
```

#### 3. Building and Testing

**Build the project:**
```bash
make build                  # Build manager binary to bin/
make docker-build           # Build Docker image
make build-installer        # Generate consolidated install.yaml
```

**Local development testing:**
```bash
# Run controller locally (requires kubeconfig)
make run

# Or install CRDs and run in-cluster
make install               # Install CRDs to cluster
make deploy               # Deploy controller to cluster
```

#### 4. Testing Different Scenarios

**Unit tests with specific coverage:**
```bash
# Test specific packages
go test -v ./api/v1 -coverprofile=api_cover.out
go test -v ./internal/controller -coverprofile=controller_cover.out

# View coverage report
go tool cover -html=cover.out -o coverage.html
```

**E2E testing workflow:**
```bash
make setup-test-e2e        # Create Kind cluster if needed
make test-e2e              # Run E2E tests
make cleanup-test-e2e      # Clean up Kind cluster
```

#### 5. Pre-commit Workflow

The project uses pre-commit hooks. Install and run them:
```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
pre-commit run --all-files
```

**Hooks include:**
- Trailing whitespace removal
- End-of-file fixing
- YAML validation
- Secret detection
- Go linting
